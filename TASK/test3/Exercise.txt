2.) Create a Class Product with the following fields
    Product(productId:String,ProductName:String,productCategory:String,Price:Double,availableCity:List<String>)
	
3.) Create a class UserCSVReader. that reads the User CSV File
	class UserCSVReader{
	    //this method reads all the user from the user csv file and return it as a List of User object
		public List<User> getAllUsers(){
		
		}
	}
4.) Create a class ProductCSVReader. that reads from the product.csv file

	    //this method reads all the product from the product csv file and return it as a List of Product object
		public List<Product> getAllProducts(){
		
		}
	}
	
5.) Create a Class ProductAvailabilityService that should have following

	 private List<Product> productList;
	 private List<User> userList;
	  //constructor
	  ProductAvailabilityService(){
	     //1.) Call UserCSVReader.getAllUsers and set the returned List<User> in the userList instance variable
		 //2.) Call ProductCSVReader.getAllProducts and set the returned List<Product> in the productList instance variable
	  }
	  
	  //Gets all the product from all the category that are available in the city where user lives
	  public List<Product> getAllProductForUser(String userId){
		// get the user from the instance variable userList for the given userId
		// get the city of the Selected User		
		// Iterate over the productList and find all those products that are available in city of the user
	  }
	  
	  public List<Product> getAllProductForUserForCategory(String userId,String productCategory){
